StackWorld is a 2D platformer where your objective is to run and jump through a multi-leveled maze to find a hidden key before time runs out, all while collecting randomly generated coins for points and clocks to gain additional time back. 

StackWorld was created with JavaScript, PhaserJS, Phaser-Es6-boilerplate, Tiled, and with the open artwork from opengameart.org

This game was created during Stackathon, a Fullstack Academy assignment to create anything we wanted within four days before presenting to the rest of the class. 

# Phaser + ES6 + Webpack.
